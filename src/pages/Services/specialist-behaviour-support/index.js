                              Our support and services include specialist behavioural intervention support, which is an intensive
                              support for a participant, intending to address significantly harmful or persistent behaviours of concern. We develop a Behaviour support plan that aims to limit the likelihood of behaviours of concern developing or increasing once identified. This plan outlines the specifically designed positive behavioural support strategies for a participant, their family and
                              support persons that will achieve the intended outcome of eliminating or reducing behaviours of concern.
