                        Florence and Michael have always had profound Interest in providing support to vulnerable people within their community.  
                        We currently provide financial support to children of low social economic levels, whom we are totally mindful of. Our profound dedication to this course was recognised and Florence was made a member of the board of Trustees of   <u>Child Plus Initiative.</u>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Following our migration to Australia, we decided to provide more front-line service to vulnerable people, which informed Florence’s decision to get a job as a disability support worker back in 2015. Owing to her passion and interest in this area, she decided to study further in Individual Care and disability. Florence has actively worked with diverse participants for over four (4) years and has gained a wealth of experience, 
                        caring for persons with complex and simple disabilities, in both community and residential home settings.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        We understand the needs of persons living with disabilities from both Medical, Social and Technological standpoints. We believe that, any human being is as strong as their “WILL” to achieve set goals, irrespective of their disability. On this principle, Torana Care Australia was born. Just like the saying, “where there is a will, there is a way”, we strengthen the “WILL” of our participants, to make “WAY” for them to be whatever they want to be, with our help. 
                        Our Support and Services aim to bridge the gap between our participant’s “will” and the “way” to their goals.
